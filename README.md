# AdvancedRecon
AdvancedRecon is an advanced web reconnaissance tool for bug bounty hunting.   It integrates multiple recon techniques in one lightweight, Python-based script.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Custom Wordlist Generation:**  
  Scrapes the target homepage to generate a tailored wordlist (saved to `wordlist.txt`) for further fuzzing.

- **Favicon Hash Analysis:**  
  Downloads the favicon (`/favicon.ico`) and computes its MD5 hash.

- **SSL Certificate Subdomain Enumeration:**  
  Queries [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) for certificates issued to the target domain and extracts subdomains.

- **Virtual Host Enumeration:**  
  Uses the custom wordlist to fuzz potential virtual hosts (e.g. `admin.example.com`) by sending HTTP requests with custom Host headers and flags candidates with a 200 status code.

- **JSON Reporting:**  
  Saves detailed results to `recon_results.json`.
